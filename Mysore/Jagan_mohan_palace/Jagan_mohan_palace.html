                   the Old Fort facing the Chamunda Hills stands as the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty who ruled the Kingdom of Mysore from 1399 to 1950. Displaying Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, this sprawling building is
                    a replacement of the old wooden building destroyed by fire in late 19th century. Commissioned by the Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV, this palatial building comprises of two durbar halls, a number of colossal courtyards, buildings
                     and strikingly beautiful gardens that speak volumes of the splendour of the Wadiyars.<br>
                     <b>History</b>

                     The Wodeyars whose roots trace back to Dv?rak?, Gujarat’s Yadava community came to Karnataka and settled in Mysore getting enthralled by its natural beauty. Starting with Yaduraya Wodeyar who founded the Wodeyar dynasty in 1399, 
                     the Yadavas ruled the area for around six centuries. He was first to build a palace within Mysore’s Old Fort in the 14th century, but that was dismantled and built several times later. Immediately after the death of Tipu Sultan in May 1799, 
                     Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar III made Mysore his capital and eventually came under the control of the British. The spelling of the royal name of the dynasty was changed to Wadiyar from Wodeyar by his successors.
                     
                     In 1897 the wooden palace was destroyed by fire while the wedding ceremony of His Highness Rajarshi Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV’s eldest sister, Princess Jayalakshmi Ammani was taking place. That year itself the young monarch and his mother, Her Majesty
                      Maharani Vani Vilas Sannidhna, regent of Mysore, delegated Lord Henry Irwin, a British architect, to construct a new palace. In 1912 the construction of the palace was completed at a cost of Rs. 4147913. It was expanded in 1940 under the rule of last
                       Maharaja of the Kingdom of Mysore, Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar.
                       <b>Architecture</b>

                       The palace is a three-storey stone structure made with fine granite, grey in colour, having deep pink marble stones atop and a five-storey tower measuring 145 ft. The size of the palace measures 245 ft. by 156 ft. Designs of the domes illustrate 
                       Indo-Saracenic architecture which was applied by the British architects in British India during the late 19th century. It incorporates elements from Indian, Indo-Islamic, Neo-Classical and Gothic revival styles. Three gates of the compound lead to the 
                       palace - the front gate (more specifically the East Gate) opens for the VVIPs and otherwise during the Dasara; the South Gate is designated for general public; and the West Gate normally remains open in Dasara. Apart from these the cellar of the palace
                        has many secret tunnels that lead to several confidential areas and other places like the town of Srirangapatna. Several fancy arches adorn the façade of the building with two smaller arches on either side of the central one that is supported with long pillars.
                         A sculpture of the goddess of good luck, prosperity and wealth, Gajalakshmi, with her elephants is seated atop the central arch. The palace facing Chamundi Hills is a manifestation of the devotion of the Maharajas of Mysore towards Goddess Chamundi. The emblem 
                         and coat of arms of the Mysore Kingdom adorns the entrance gate and arch. A large, beautiful and well-maintained garden surrounding the palace makes the site even more spectacular.  
                         <b>Attractions & Events</b>

                         The Mysore Palace, the seat of the famous Wodeyar Maharaja's of the Mysore Kingdom today stands as one of the precious possessions of the nation which is presently converted into a museum. The strikingly embellished and finely chiselled doors lead one to richly and
                          elegantly ornate rooms. The exquisitely columned Durbar Hall, the solid silver doors, the finely incised mahogany ceilings and many other embellishments of the palace make one spellbound while giving an idea of the exuberant lifestyle of the royals. Displays in the
